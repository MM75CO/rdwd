rdwd: DWD Climate Data access package by Berry Boessenkool, berry-b@gmx.de
Any feedback is welcome, per email or on github.com/brry/rdwd
---------------------------------------


Version 0.. (2016--)
Initial release of the package, development can be seen at
https://github.com/brry/rdwd/compare/master@{2016-10-19}...master@{2016-11-xx}

'indexDWD' lists all the files on the FTP server with DWD data.
With 'index2df', it is used to create 'fileIndex', which then helps create 'metaIndex'.
'selectDWD' uses all that to find files matching a path or station criteria.
With the returned path/file names, 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' download and read data.
'dirDWD' and 'fileDWD' control that no file will be overwritten and path messages are useful.

Note: 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' were started in June 2016 within my misc package
berryFunctions, from which they will be deleted after rdwd is on CRAN
