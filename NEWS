rdwd ToDo-list / wishlist / issues
- translations for colnames (in doc only? metaIndex / vs current=TRUE)
- change tests to actually test stuff, maybe add third vignette
- dataDWD: potentially use curl to download data without sleep need
- selectDWD: if res/var/per is NA or "", give a selection popup
- check out small wrapper on top of data.table::fread() which will read zipped files directly (without preliminary unzipping to disk):

Version 0.6.1 (2017-01-24)
Initial release of the package, development can be seen at
https://github.com/brry/rdwd/compare/master@{2016-10-19}...master@{2017-01-24}

'selectDWD' uses index information to find files matching a path or station criteria.
With the returned path/file names, 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' download and read data.
'dirDWD' and 'fileDWD' control that no file will be overwritten and path messages are useful.
'indexDWD' lists all the files on the FTP server with DWD data.
'createIndex' uses that list to create 'fileIndex', 'metaIndex' and 'geoIndex'.
'mapDWD' is an interactive leaflet map also useful to explore datasets.

Note: 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' were started in June 2016 within my misc package
berryFunctions, from which they will be deleted after rdwd is on CRAN
