\title{Create a recursive index of the DWD CDC FTP Server}
\usage{
indexDWD(folder = "",
  base = "ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate",
  sleep = 0, dir = "DWDdata", quiet = FALSE, progbar = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder}{Folder to be indexed recursively, e.g. "hourly/wind/".
DEFAULT: "" (all folders at \code{base})}

\item{base}{Main directory of DWD ftp server, defaulting to observed climatic records.
DEFAULT: ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate"}

\item{sleep}{If not 0, a random number of seconds between 0 and \code{sleep}
is passed to \code{\link{Sys.sleep}} after each read folder
to avoid getting kicked off the FTP-Server. DEFAULT: 0}

\item{dir}{Writeable directory name where to save the downloaded file.
Created if not existent. DEFAULT: "DWDdata" at current \code{\link{getwd}()}}

\item{quiet}{Suppress message about directory and failed
\code{RCurl::\link[RCurl]{getURL}}? DEFAULT: FALSE}

\item{progbar}{Logical: present a progress bar in each level?
Only works if the R package pbapply is available. DEFAULT: TRUE}

\description{
Create a list of all the files (in subfolders) at the Climate Data Center (CDC)
FTP-Server from the German Weather Service (DWD, Deutscher WetterDienst) at
\url{ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate}.\cr
If it fails, because bot access is detected and denied, there will stil be an
output which you can pass in a second run via \code{folder} to extract the remaining dirs.
You might want to set \code{sleep=10} or similar in that case.
}
\details{
It's not suggested to run this for all folders, as it can take quite some time
and you may get kicked off the FTP-Server. This package contains an index
of the 'regular' climatic observations at weather stations.
ToDo: put reference here.
If it is out of date, please let me know!
